# WAD2_GroupProject
Collaborative Repo for our Web App Development Course's Group Project

## What should be included
### 1. an overview of the application (i.e., what it is meant to do) – 1 slide;
Contains sufficient detail so that the reader can understand what the web
app is supposed to do.

### 2. user personas for the application – 2 or 3 slides;
One description for each type of user – each should convey background
about the user and in particular what they want to do.

### 3. the specification i.e. the minimal list of requirements – 1 slide;
The list of requirements should be sufficiently detailed for it to be clear how
the web app will fulfil the needs of the intended users.

### 4. a high-level system architecture diagram – 1 slide;
This high-level diagram should include the different components of the
system and any additional APIs from external services that might be used.

### 5. an ER Diagram (this must be in compressed Chen notation), along with a description of
the attributes (with their data types) for each entity – 1 slide;
The model should be relevant and appropriate in the context of the
specification. The diagram should adhere to compressed Chen notation
and should give data types for the attributes in the separate tables.

### 6. a number of wireframes to show the main functionality of the system – at least 3 and at
most 6 slides;
The wireframes should include login functionality and context. There
should be a sufficient number to illustrate the functionality provided by the
app as indicated by the specification

### 7. a walkthrough of the main features, in the form of a site map and site URLs – 2 slides.
This should be presented in the form of a site map and a list of site URLs
which make it clear how the different templates of the app are named and
linked together.
